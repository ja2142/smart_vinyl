# Smart Vinyl

A forge mod for playing music from youtube using ordinary jukebox.

Based heavily on [fabric version](https://github.com/Rubydesic/minecraft-dynamic-discs) of the same thing (it's really something between port and rewrite).

Just like Rubydesic's version, built on top of [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) for getting streams from youtube and [velvet-video](https://github.com/zakgof/velvet-video) for decoding them.

## Usage

 1. Place the jar in mods/ directory for client and server.
 2. In game, craft a smart music disc, with 2 pieces of coal and 2 pieces of flint.
 3. Rename disc in anvil, either to song title (e.g. "never gonna five you up"), or youtube id (url part after "watch?v=" e.g. "DLzxrzFCyOs").
 4. Put disc in jukebox.
 5. ???
 6. Profit
