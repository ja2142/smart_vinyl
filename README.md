# Smart Vinyl

A forge mod for playing music from youtube using ordinary jukebox.

Based heavily on [fabric version](https://github.com/Rubydesic/minecraft-dynamic-discs) of the same thing (it's really something between port and rewrite).

Just like Rubydesic's version, built on top of [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) for getting streams from youtube and [velvet-video](https://github.com/zakgof/velvet-video) for decoding them.

## Using it

Place the jar in mods/ directory for client and server.
